# a variable is a reference to an object. That object is subject to change
# variables are sometimes called pointers or identifiers
# tha variable itself is not an object. It is a placeholder for an object
# Ruby is dynamically typed. variables donot have to be declared
# variables are pointed to an object with the equal sign(=)
# variables name should start with a lowercase or underscore
# spaces are not allowed. user underscores instead (lower_snake_case)
# variables names are case-sensitive
# don't use any of ruby's reserved keywords (i.e puts or print)
